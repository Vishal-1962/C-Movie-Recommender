### ðŸ’¡ Project Overview: C Movie Recommendation System

This project is a console-based Movie Recommendation System developed entirely in **C programming language**. The core motivation was to solve the personal frustration of spending excessive time searching for suitable movies across platforms filled with noise, ads, and login barriers.

The system provides a **fast, ad-free, and privacy-focused** solution for movie discovery. It efficiently loads a local dataset (`movieslist.txt`) and allows users to filter recommendations based on concrete criteria: **genre, release year, language, and minimum user rating**. Technically, this project demonstrates robust implementation of **File I/O and parsing (`strtok`)**, effective use of **structs** for data representation, and custom functions for **case-insensitive string searching and sanitization**, showcasing strong foundational C development skills.
